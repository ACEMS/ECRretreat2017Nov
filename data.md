We then discussed the data sources that we have access to.

In terms of open data, we discussed:

- [Australian Flights Data](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ozflights)
- [Australian Road Deaths](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/ozroaddeaths)
- UK police data: [UKpolice R package](http://ukpolice.njtierney.com/), [UK police data website](https://data.police.uk/)
- [Pedestrian count data in Melbourne](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rwalkr)
- [E atlas data](http://eatlas.org.au/eatlas-georss-items/40)

We then discussed the different datasets that we each work with
