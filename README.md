# ECRretreat2017Nov

ACEMS Early Career Researchers are getting together.

The retreat will be as practical as possible with minimal presentations. There will be plenty of talks at the Main Retreat and 5 days of talks is too many.   

This is a readme file for the 2017 ECR Retreat Repository. There are two locations you need to check out as a participant of the retreat. 1. the wiki page - which contains handy info about the retreat, and 2. the issues page - which is were you can post project ideas.    
   

## Draft programme
The draft programme can be found in the Wiki, see the tab above 

We're planning the collaborative research projects and discussion sessions. These are sessions you contribute to. more details about these sessions are on the wiki, but head over [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) tab now and post some ideas. 

The programme will include: 
* Unstructured collaborative projects
* IP workshop
* invited speakers
* mentoring to the PhD students
* opportunities to meet other ECRs 
* round table-esk discussion sessions
* BBQ, beach and food.   
   
   
### The Unstructured Collaborative Sessions
These sessions are about collaboration and discussing/working on projects you are interested in. They work like this: 
1. You add projects you are interested in working on, or a topic your interseted in discussing to the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) page **before the retreat**. Preceed posts with either `PROJECT:` or `SESSION:`.   
2. On day 1, we discuss the project ideas and you decide what you would like to work on.
3. During the collaborative sessions, you work on your project of interest. 

head over to the wiki for more details on [Session Planning](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/wiki/Session-planning)

**Some Guidelines/Common Questions** 
* You can change projects as much as you like. 
* You can work on a project you didn't suggest.
* There are no expected outcomes.
* You are not expected to finish the project by the end of the retreat. 
* The aim is to learn new skills, meet new collaborators, work on a project you find interesting.
