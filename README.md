ACEMS Early Career Researchers are getting together

## Draft programme

The draft programme can be found in the wiki. We're planning the collaborative research projects and unstructured sessions in the Issues tab. Why not head on over, see what people are suggesting, make a few comments and pitch your own idea?

## Discussion

Planning the retreat is happening in the `#ecr_retreat_team` on the ACEMS Slack. ECRs are discussing things in `#postdocs`.  If you don't have access to the ACEMS slack, contact [Jessie Roberts](jessie.roberts@qut.edu.au)
