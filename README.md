# ECRretreat2017Nov

ACEMS Early Career Researchers are getting together.

The retreat will be as practical as possible with minimal presentations. There will be plenty of talks at the Main Retreat and 5 days of talks is too many.

There are two important resources on this wiki page - The wiki and issues. 

## The Wiki 
All information and detail for the retreat are housed on the Repository wiki. See the tab above. You will find information about the programme, how to suggest an idea, how the unstructured and collabortive sessions will work as well as other housekeep info. 

[Wiki](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/wiki) for all the retreat details and information, and check out the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) page to see what collaborative projects people are suggesting. 
   

## Programme
A draft programme can be found on the wiki page, as well as information about how the collaborative research projects and focus group discussion will work. 
   
   
## Unstructured Collaborative Sessions
These sessions are about collaboration and discussing/working on projects you are interested in. They work like this: 
1. You add projects you are interested in working on, or a topic your interseted in discussing to the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) page **before the retreat**. Preceed posts with either `PROJECT:` or `SESSION:`.   
2. On day 1, we discuss the project ideas and you decide what you would like to work on.
3. During the collaborative sessions, you work on your project of interest. 


**Some Guidelines/Common Questions** 
* You can change projects as much as you like. 
* You can work on a project you didn't suggest.
* There are no expected outcomes.
* You are not expected to finish the project by the end of the retreat. 
* The aim is to learn new skills, meet new collaborators, work on a project you find interesting.
