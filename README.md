# ECRretreat2017Nov

ACEMS Early Career Researchers are getting together.

The retreat will be as practical as possible with minimal presentations. There will be plenty of talks at the Main Retreat and 5 days of talks is too many.   

   

## Draft programme
The draft programme can be found in the Wiki, see the tab above or click [here](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/wiki). We're planning the collaborative research projects and unstructured sessions in the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) tab. Why not head on over, see what people are suggesting, make a few comments and pitch your own idea?   

The programme will include: 
* unstructure collaborative sessions
* IP workshop
* invited speakers
* mentoring to the PhD students
* opportunities to meet other ECRs 
* round table discussions
* BBQ, beach and food.   
   
   
### The Unstructured Sessions
These sessions are about collaboration and discussing/working on projects you are interested in. They work like this: 
1. You add projects you are interested in workingo on to the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) page **before the retreat**.
2. On day 1, we discuss the project ideas and you decide what you would like to work on.
3. During the collaborative sessions, you work on your project of interest. 

**Some Guidelines/Common Questions** 
* You can change projects as much as you like. 
* You can work on a project you didn't suggest.
* There are no expected outcomes.
* You are not expected to finish the project by the end of the retreat. 
* The aim is to learn new skills, meet new collaborators, work on a project you find interesting. 
* You get out what you put in.
