# ECRretreat2017Nov

ACEMS Early Career Researchers are getting together.

The ECR Retreat is designed to be as practical as possible, with minimal presentations. This is because working on projects is fun, and also because the Main Retreat will be jam packed full of talks, and 5 days of talks is pretty difficult to remain focused through.   

The programme will include unstructure collaborative sessions, an IP workshop, invited speakers who will their different career trajectories, getting to know each other, some mentoring to the PhD students, a few round table discussions and food.    

## Draft programme

The draft programme can be found in the Wiki, see the tab above or click [here](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/wiki). We're planning the collaborative research projects and unstructured sessions in the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) tab. Why not head on over, see what people are suggesting, make a few comments and pitch your own idea?

## The Unstructured Sessions
These sessions are about collaboration and discussing/working on projects you are interested in. They work like this: 
1. You add projects you are interested in workingo on to the [Issues](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) page **before the retreat**.
2. On day 1, we discuss the project ideas and you decide what you would like to work on.
3. During the collaborative sessions, you work on your project of interest. 

Some Guidelines/Common Questions 
* You can change projects as much as you like. 
* You can work on a project you didn't suggest.
* There are no expected outcomes.
* You are not expected to finish the project by the end of the retreat. 
* The aim is to learn new skills, meet new collaborators, work on a project you find interesting. 
* You get out what you put in.
