## Project sessions

If you ran one of the project sessions, it is anticipated that you will edit this file to give a short report on how the session went, who was involved, what outcomes were achieved and what the plan for the future is.

Project proposals are available at the [Issues page](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) and the proramme at [the Wiki](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/wiki/Programme). Use the issue number in the header to help identify which session it was.

### 1/14 Teaching and Writing a book

These two sessions were run by Sam Clifford with participants Brodie Lawson, Tarunendu Mapder, Azam Asanjarani, Nick Tierney, Arthur Hung, Ross McVinish. In the first session, we discussed the issues around engaging students in first year service units, identifying and overcoming lack of background knowledge, designing teaching materials around problem based learning, live coding to show that teaching staff are capable of mistakes, whether we have the freedom to develop our own lecture material and whether this includes the case when there is no expectation as to content and approach from the school.

The second session, on writing a book, was focussed on the development of a book for first year STEM students that is not so much a comprehensive textbook as an overview of important topics from algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, visualisation, and communication. The book would be online, simply written, application-driven, and make use of storytelling techniques to provide a wide variety of applications in the sciences and engineering that require different types of mathematics and data analysis. Providing example code to copy, paste, run and modify would help show the usage of these techniques to solve the problems and then additional contexts would be provide for a "now you try" approach. The end of each chapter would show a little more detail for the theory and provide references to other resources (desirably online and open) for those who wish to read more about the topic.

A GitHub repo and Slack channel have been created for Sam, Azam, Arthur, Tarun, Jessie Roberts and Nick to continue work on this project.


### 2 - Speed dating

This session was run by Sam Clifford at the Monday evening BBQ jointly with the PhD students. 40 minutes was spent at the park using a lottery system (pairs with raffle tickets) to give the PhD students and ECRs some time to ask questions of each other about what kind of research they did as well as what research life is like. A bag of question prompts was made available for when participants couldn't think of what to say.

Feedback from students was that they appreciated getting the opportunity to talk to one or two postdocs and even to discuss their issues one on one with each other. Postdocs enjoyed the experience of talking to the students and getting to know the wider ACEMS community. It was heartening that after the session itself had wrapped up students and postdocs continued talking to each other throughout the BBQ. This format would be repeatable in the future and would be good to have some AIs and CIs available to have contact with the other levels of ACEMS.

### 9 - Challenges faced by ECRs

This session was ran by Azam Asanjarani. In this session, we consider some challenges faced by ECRs such as supervision of students, best way of starting a fruitful collaboration, doubt about academic carrier, and how become prepared for an academic job interview. There were more than 10 ECRs in this session and we enjoyed learning from Prof. Matt Wand’s and Prof. Robert Kohn’s comments and experiences.

### 18 Egg Packing Competition

The egg packing competition was a competition (with prizes!) made available to ACEMS students. After some interest from some of the Postdocs, a separate competition was also made available to that group. The basic page for the problem is [here](https://acems.org.au/2017-student-competition) and the page created for the Postdocs is [here](https://acemsproblemsolvingcomp2017.wordpress.com). In both cases, the goal is the same - given a set of points on a 2D square, each with an associated circle of given radius, we must find the largest number of these circles we can "turn on" in order to maximise the area covered. This is referred to as "egg packing" because the provided application was a set of locations for a frog to lay her eggs such that the maximum number of eggs would be able to grow to full size. To give an idea of the scope of the problem, the postdoc competition involved 100,000 possible sites, and good solutions were turning on 2100+ sites - there are a very large number of possible combinations and only a small fraction of the sites will end up turned on.

We used the opportunity of the retreat to compare and contrast the submitted solutions to the postdoc side of the competition, then coded up the submitted algorithms in a consistent framework so we could compare their solution-finding performance and timings. These varied from a simple greedy algorithm with a clever piece of intuition that allowed for the generation of surprisingly good results, to an algorithm that sought to gradually explore very large numbers of possible states, whilst guaranteeing that the solutions it generated never grew worse. The decision was reached to write up the problem and the techniques applied to solve it in a more formal fashion - at least as a full blog post, or possibly a conference or arxiv article. To this end, we investigated what possible links there are between this problem and others of mathematical interest, also noting that the problem can be formulated exactly as an integer programming problem. Our discussions at the retreat culminated with a presentation.

Primary members of this Project group were Brodie Lawson, Wilson Chen, Ross McVinish and Slava Vaisman, although many others did also contribute!
