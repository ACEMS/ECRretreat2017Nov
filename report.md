# Report on activities of ECR Retreat

## Introduction

This document lists the activities of the November 2017 ECR Retreat, particularly the project and discussion sessions. If you ran one of the project sessions, it is anticipated that you will edit this file to give a short report on how the session went, who was involved, what outcomes were achieved and what the plan for the future is.

Project proposals are available at the [Issues page](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/issues) and the proramme at [the Wiki](https://github.com/ACEMS/ECRretreat2017Nov/wiki/Programme). Use the issue number in the header to help identify which session it was.

This session was run by Sam Clifford at the Monday evening BBQ jointly with the PhD students. 40 minutes was spent at the park using a lottery system (pairs with raffle tickets) to give the PhD students and ECRs some time to ask questions of each other about what kind of research they did as well as what research life is like. A bag of question prompts was made available for when participants couldn't think of what to say.

Feedback from students was that they appreciated getting the opportunity to talk to one or two postdocs and even to discuss their issues one on one with each other. Postdocs enjoyed the experience of talking to the students and getting to know the wider ACEMS community. It was heartening that after the session itself had wrapped up students and postdocs continued talking to each other throughout the BBQ. This format would be repeatable in the future and would be good to have some AIs and CIs available to have contact with the other levels of ACEMS.
