# Building the programme together

An expectation of us as ECRs is that we all have skills and/or ideas to contribute to the group. In order to determine sessions to be run during the unstructured periods, we are gathering proposals.

## Suggesting a session

Please head over to the Issues tab and post a session you'd be willing to lead the development of, whether that's you presenting or asking for others to talk on a topic you're interested in.

We would like to keep things are broad and diverse as possible, so please don't feel this needs to be a traditional talk. Some suggested formats include:

* traditional talk
* fireside chat/panel discussion
* interactive activity
* teaching a technique or programming language
* solving an open problem

## Boosting a session

If you like the idea of a suggested session, please leave a comment or reaction emoji to indicate your support for that session including whether you'd like to get involved in putting that session together.

## Unsure as to what to do?

If you're still a little unsure as to what to do, have a look at the AuUnconf2017's github page for doing the same sort of thing https://github.com/AU-BURGr/UnConf2017/issues
